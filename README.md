## Description  
Imagine you have a pool of ideas but it is overflowing. Faucets of thoughts continually filling this pool. It is your job to turn off the valves for each idea so you can come to a solid stream of directional flow.

ThinkSync is a website that after creating an account, allows you to narrow down a set of ideas under a general topic or question. All of the entered ideas are then paired together, forcing the user to select a winner from each pair. They are then shuffled, paired again, and the cycle continues until a final winner for your topic or question. The vote count for each idea and the final result is stored in your account.
